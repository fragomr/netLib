### What is netLib?

The netLib Network Communication Library is a free, open-source C library for network communication over TCP/IP. It currently compiles on Windows, Unix (Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X) and BeOS. The netLib Network Communication Library was designed for simplicity, portability, and ease of use.

### How to use netLib

Consult the manual in the docs folder or check for the latest version online at http://bubbai.ath.cx/projects/netlib/manual.html
The included testclient, testserver, bufferclient, bufferserver, and chat programs can be used as guides for your own programs.
All included examples except for echoserver require netBuffer as well.
The next section contains example on how to include netLib with your program (replace yournetapp.c with testserver.c or testclient.c).


### Compile Example

This was verified to work with different versions of the GCC compiler.
Tested OS's were Windows (2000, XP and Vista), Mac OS X (10.3 and 10.4), BeOS 5, and Linux (Fedora 7, Ubuntu 7.04, and Debian 4.0).

Windows:

	gcc yournetapp.c netSocket.c netBuffer.c -o yournetapp -DMS_WINDOWS -L../lib/win32 -lwsock32

Unix/Mac:

	gcc yournetapp.c netSocket.c netBuffer.c -o yournetapp -DUNIX

BeOS:

		gcc yournetapp.c netSocket.c netBuffer.c -o yournetapp -DBEOS

BeOS BONE:

	gcc yournetapp.c netSocket.c netBuffer.c -o yournetapp -DBEOS -lsocket

BeOS note: netLib has not been testing with Haiku.

To compile the buffer client on Windows you would use the command line:

	gcc bufferclient.c netSocket.c netBuffer.c -o bufferclient -DMS_WINDOWS -L../lib/win32 -lwsock32

To compile the chat server on Unix you would use the command line:

	gcc chatserver.c netSocket.c netBuffer.c -o chatserver -DUNIX

To compile the echo server on BeOS you would use the command line:

	gcc echoserver.c netSocket.c -o echoserver -DUNIX
